# Getting Clojure

Me coding along the "Getting Clojure" book (v1.0) by Russ Olsen.

* Book: https://pragprog.com/book/roclojure/getting-clojure
* Soure Code examples: https://pragprog.com/titles/roclojure/source_code

The source code examples are not included in the repo. Some exercises expect them to be installed as `/book-examples/` in the repository root.

I used Atom with the following packages

* [Ciebiada/clojure-indent](https://atom.io/packages/clojure-indent)
* [jasongilman/proto-repl](https://atom.io/packages/proto-repl)
